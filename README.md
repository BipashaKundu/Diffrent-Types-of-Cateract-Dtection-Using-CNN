# Diffrent-Types-of-Cateract-Dtection-Using-CNN

An Image Processing Technique and a traditional Covolution Neural Network has been applied in this project. The first part of this project takes an Image(Healthy Eye/ Cateract Eye) as input and determines if there is a cateract. If there is an Image of a Healthy Eye, it returns a text box saying "Its a Healthy Eye". If there is an image of with cateract, it says its "Cateract Eye" and the CNN predicts the types of Cateract. The CNN is trained with two types if Cateract Images i.e Nuclear and Capsular.

The Primary Accuracy: 80.33%

Due to the limitaion of Images in the Dataset which is 138 in total, Data Augmentation has been applied. And later an comparison of accuracy have been provided with Data Augmentiona and Without Data Augmentation.
